# Emergency Vehicles Classification
Using computer vision to build models that would recognise an emergency and non-emergency
vehicles can aid reduction in the rate of fatalities due to traffic delays of emergency vehicles.
Some examples of emergency vehicles include Ambulances, Fire brigades, police cars, etc.

### This project used  Convoluted Neural Networks(CNN) to build and train a model to identify emergency and non-emergency vehicles.
At the end of the model training and evaluation, validation accuracy was capped around 65%, accuracy 88.09%, validation loss of 81% and loss of 27%, all at five CNN layers and epoch of 20. The model suffered overfitting when there were multiple layers and increased epochs. The model was optimal when the layer was less, ten epochs were used to train.
